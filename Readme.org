* My C- - Compiler
This project is a compiler of a simplified version of C, it compiles to Assembly (64 bits).
It is inspired by the course proposed in the school ENS Paris-Saclay: http://www.lsv.fr/~goubault/CoursProgrammation/MiniC1/minic.html.

I implemented the translation of the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of ~C--~ to an assembly code. The main part of this project is written in ocaml.
** Compile the project
To download and compile the project, make sure you have ocaml installed :
: sudo apt-get install ocaml

Then just do :
: git clone https://github.com/ethanlarrar/Compiler_Cminusminus.git
: cd Compiler_Cminusminus
: make

** Compile your own C- - file
The mcc file given is the compiler. To run an example you can do for example
: cd Exemples/
: ../mcc conditions.c
: ./conditions.out

Please note that the integers are in 64 bits, so instead of using =%d= (in scanf or printf), prefer using =%llu= (if you don't, it works often, but can lead to some strange bug, especially with negative and big numbers).
